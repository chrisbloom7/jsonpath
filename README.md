# jsonpath scripts
Tidied versions of [Stefan Goessner's jsonPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) scripts.

To try to better understand Goessner's JSONPath spec implementation I have been cleaning up the old versions of the files from his [old Google Code repository](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jsonpath/). No functionality has been added or removed, I've simply cleaned up the formatting, updated the variable names to be more meaningful, and added some debugging output.

Full credit goes to Stefan Goessner for this library and it's functionality. If you decided to fork this repository please leave this attribution in place.
